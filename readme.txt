Hello! My name is Skyler and I am learning the ins and outs of html, css, and JS. Follow me on my journey to creating a website about myself so you can get to know not only how I code and operate around criteria but also get to know a little about me in the process. The first iteration of my website is just html, it has information about me in ordered lists, unordered lists, and hyperlinks to some of my favorite foods etc. The image on my site is a relative link to a file, but I also know how to create an absolute link to an image, although it is not represented here. Thanks for taking an interest in my coding journey and I hope to hear back from you!
